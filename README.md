In instance, a commodity is bought by the group of 5 friends but 2 are unable to pay the
expenses for the time being. So, the price of the commodity will be covered by the remaining 3
people. Wrapping up, 2 of them owe money to the rest. These kinds of transactions happen all
of the time. Pay Share helps to manage these types of shared expenses.
